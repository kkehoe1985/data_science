For each distribution, we could identify the interquartile range 'IQR' by subtracting Q1 from Q3. We would then subtract [IQR * 1.5] from Q1 to obtain the lower bound, and add [IQR * 1.5] to Q3 to obtain the upper bound. Any data points below the lower bound or above the upper bound can be considered outliers. We could do the same thing for GPA."
